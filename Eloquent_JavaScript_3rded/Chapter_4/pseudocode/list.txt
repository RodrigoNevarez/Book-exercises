A list is a nested set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, 
the second to the third, and so on.

/** Brief: Builds a list structure given an array.
* Parameter array: array to build list from.
* Return: The list deriving from the array.
*/
def arrayToList( any[] array ){
  If the array is empty:
    Link rest to null, there are no more elements to link.
  Create an empty list with value equal to the arrays first element
    and create another list with an array composed of the remaining values of array
  Return that list
} 

/** Brief: Builds an array given a list structure.
* Parameter list: list to build array from.
* Return: The array deriving from the list.

def listToArray( Object list ){
  If there are no more elements linked in the list:
    Return an array that holds the value of the last element of the list.
  Convert the remaining list of elements into an array.
  Add value to the beginning of the list
  Return set array.
} 

/** Brief: Takes an element and a list and creates a new list with the 
*   element to the front of the input list.
* Parameter element: Element to add in front of the list.
* Parameter list: list to prepend to element.

def prepend( any element, Object list ){
  Return a list with element as 'value' property and old list as 'rest' property.

/** Brief: Returns the element at the given position in the list.
* Parameter list: Input list to return element from.
* Parameter i: Index number of the list (with zero referring to the first element).
*   Refers to the number of calls to function.

def nth( Object list, unsigned int i ){
  Check if i is out of range: // When calls to the function are exhausted or i is less than 0
    return undefined
  If you called nth function i times:
    Return the value associated to list element.
  Return another call to nth decrementing i by one and moving to the next element in the list
